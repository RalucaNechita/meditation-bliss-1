## Features

### Navigation

- At the top of the website page we can find the navigation bar which direct us to 4 different sections of the website called: "Home", "About us", "Benefits of meditation", and "Sign-up". These are located right underneath the logo. 
- The color of the navigation bar is dark grey which offers a nice contrast along the white text and the background image. I have also decided on this color as it is neutral and calming to the users eyes.
- The navigation bar makes the different pages and information easy to find for all users.
- The navigation bar position is set on sticky for an improved user experience as it allows the visitors to access certain parts of the website with only one click instead of having to scroll up and down to find the desired information.

- The background image of the header is a woman meditating which enhances the purpose of the website and gives the user a calming state of mind.
- Underneath the picture the background color is light pink, a color that is warm and relaxing usually linked to meditating.

### About us

- The text font color matches with the header and footer which offers a visually pleasing experience and the contrast between the background color and the text makes it easy to read.

### Benefits of meditation

- This section of the website was created to offer users information about the benefits of meditating.
- Having a benefits section can also increase the number of new members the club can get as readers looking to improve their quality of life would be more likely to sign up once they know what aspects of their life can be improved when starting to meditate.
- The font size and color are the same as in the about us section in order to keep a clean and good looking aspect of the website.

### Sign up 

- The sign up section has a form to collect the necessary member information in order to sign up to Meditation Bliss Club. 
- The form asks for the users name and email address. 
- To be able to sign up the member has to complete both fields and give a valid email address. If failed to do so the form will not accept the application and require the user to enter the correct information.

- All the links open in a new tab, so that the user experience of the main website is not disturbed.
- In the footer section we can also find the name of the club and year when it was updated.
- The background color of the footer and font color is kept the same as in the navigation bar so that it offers a balance and visual pleasing overall look.
- The position of the footer is set on sticky to give the user the oportunity to access the social media at all times without having to scroll to the end of the page.
